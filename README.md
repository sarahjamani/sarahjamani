My Portfolio website is a multi-page website built using HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). The website is divided into seven distinct sections, each showcasing a specific aspect of my work, skills, or experiences.

"My portfolio website is a meticulously crafted digital showcase, divided into seven distinct sections: Home, About, Skills, Projects, Resume, Contact, and Footer. With a keen eye for detail, I leveraged my creativity to design and develop this website from scratch using HTML and CSS. Each section is carefully structured with relevant HTML tags, and styled with precise CSS properties, resulting in a visually appealing and user-friendly interface. From the introductory Home section to the in-depth About page, and from the showcased Projects to the downloadable Resume, every aspect of my website reflects my passion for web development and design. The Contact section invites visitors to get in touch, while the Footer provides additional context and links. This portfolio website is a testament to my skills and creativity, and I'm excited to share it with the world!"
